  <h1 style="color:lime; text-align:center;">📊 Track Your Gambling Wins and Losses</h1>

  <p>Keeping track of your gambling sessions is one of the smartest things you can do. Most players don't realize how much they're spending, how often they're playing, or how much they're really losing — until it's too late.</p>

  <h2 style="color:cyan;">Why Tracking Matters</h2>
  <p>Gambling can be fun and exciting, but without proper control, it can lead to serious financial and emotional consequences. That’s where tracking comes in. A simple log of your sessions — how much you brought, how much you left with, what you played, and how you felt — gives you power over your habits.</p>

  <p>Tracking your wins and losses helps you:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>✅ Spot patterns in your behavior</li>
    <li>✅ See your real performance — not just your lucky nights</li>
    <li>✅ Set limits based on facts, not feelings</li>
    <li>✅ Recognize when gambling is hurting your budget or your life</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color:cyan;">Free Bankroll Tracker</h2>
  <p>We’ve built a <strong>free downloadable spreadsheet</strong> to help you take control. Use it after every session, whether you play online, in a casino, or even socially.</p>

  <h2 style="color:cyan;">What to Track</h2>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>🎲 Game played (craps, slots, blackjack, etc.)</li>
    <li>💵 Starting bankroll and ending amount</li>
    <li>📆 Date and time</li>
    <li>📍 Location (casino name or online site)</li>
    <li>🧠 Mental/emotional state (calm, stressed, excited, etc.)</li>
    <li>📝 Notes about your play or strategy used</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color:cyan;">Build Habits Like a Pro</h2>
  <p>The best gamblers in the world treat gambling like a business. They review their performance, stay disciplined, and use data to make smarter decisions. You should too.</p>

  <p>Review your tracker weekly or monthly. Are you staying within your budget? Are certain games costing you more than you realized? Are your losses going up when you're emotional or chasing wins?</p>

  <h2 style="color:red;">Final Tip</h2>
  <p>If you're afraid to track your sessions, that’s a red flag. Avoiding the truth only gives gambling more power over you. Take it back. Track your play and stay in control.</p>
