  <p>A smart combo of Pass Line + Odds + 2 Come Bets with odds. Keeps 3 numbers working. Great for disciplined players using odds properly.</p>

  <h3 style="color:lime;">💰 3. Pass Line with Odds Only</h3>

  <h3 style="color:lime;">🧱 4. Don't Pass Hedge System</h3>
  <p>Bet Don’t Pass, but use small bets on the Field or Place numbers to reduce boredom and cover losing streaks. Great for grinding.</p>

  <h3 style="color:lime;">📊 5. 10% Bankroll Stop-Loss</h3>
