    <h2>📘 What Is the Craps Edge Strategy (And Why It Works)</h2>
    <p>The CrapsEdge™ strategy is designed to help everyday players beat the emotional traps of the casino using logic, math, and personal control. Unlike flashy betting systems that promise the world and deliver losses, CrapsEdge™ focuses on reducing house edge, slowing play, and maximizing discipline.</p>

    <p>Instead of chasing hot streaks, you follow a plan: bet only on the best math-backed options (like Pass Line + Odds), limit your time at the table, and track your results. The CrapsEdge™ system includes a custom bankroll tracker and a 50-page Stop Gambling Guide built to attack addiction triggers from both a numbers and emotional angle.</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever told yourself, “just one more roll,” you’re not alone. CrapsEdge™ shows you why that mindset keeps you stuck—and how to replace it with real control. Whether you're trying to win smarter or stop completely, this strategy gives you the edge casinos don’t want you to have.</p>

  <!-- REALISTIC EXAMPLES -->
  <section>
    <h2>🎲 Mike R. – “Didn’t Think I Had a Problem”</h2>
    <p>I used to hit the craps table after work a few nights a week. I wasn’t blowing thousands, just $100 here and there — but over time, I noticed I was going more often and chasing losses. CrapsEdge™ didn’t feel like a lecture. It made me think about *why* I was going back, what patterns I had. I started using the tracker just to see how much I was spending, and that alone made me cut back. I still go sometimes, but now I set limits. I haven’t drained my bank account in months. That’s a win for me.</p>

    <h2>👩🏽 Erica D. – “Quitting’s Hard, but I’m Getting There”</h2>
    <p>I’ve tried to quit gambling before, but nothing stuck. CrapsEdge™ didn’t give me a magic fix — but it gave me tools. The guide helped me figure out my triggers, and I realized stress was the big one. Now I don’t touch the dice unless I’m in a good headspace. I’m not perfect, but I’ve had more clean weeks than I’ve had in years. I’m learning not to hate myself over a relapse. That mindset shift came straight from the guide.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Chris L. – “I Just Needed a Plan”</h2>
    <p>For me, gambling was mostly about control. I’d win $300 and feel powerful. Then I’d lose $500 the next day. CrapsEdge™ made me realize I never had a plan. I just reacted. Now I follow the bankroll system, use the tracker, and limit myself to two short sessions a week. I still play, but I don’t chase. That alone has helped me save more money in the last 3 months than I did all last year.</p>
