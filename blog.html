  <h2 style="color:cyan;">🎲 James T. – “I Was 47 and Broke”</h2>
  <p>I’ve gambled since I was 18. It started with fun. Then it became survival. I was constantly chasing, lying, borrowing from my sister, using rent money for the casino. I felt worthless. I found CrapsEdge™ at a breaking point. The Stop Gambling Guide didn’t lecture — it understood. Page by page, it helped me face the damage, take control of my triggers, and for the first time in my life... stop gambling cold. Now, I’m 7 months clean. My sister actually smiles at me again. I track every dollar. I no longer need the rush — I’m addicted to peace. CrapsEdge™ saved my life, no exaggeration.</p>

  <h2 style="color:cyan;">👩🏽 Jasmine M. – “I Needed a Win That Wasn’t at the Casino”</h2>
  <p>I’m a single mom. My son is 6. I used to sneak off to gamble while my mom watched him. I told myself I was trying to win for him — but I was really avoiding my emotions. CrapsEdge™ helped me see how much I was losing — not just money, but time, presence, and self-worth. The emotional parts of the guide made me cry, then act. I’ve replaced gambling with journaling, therapy, and saving. My son now sees a mom who shows up — not a mom who disappears. This product didn’t just help me quit... it helped me believe I deserve better.</p>

  <h2 style="color:cyan;">🧠 Marcus P. – “From Math Whiz to Debt Prisoner”</h2>
  <p>I used to pride myself on being logical — I’m an engineer. But gambling turned me into a desperate man. I was trying to “beat the system,” convinced I had an edge. I didn’t. CrapsEdge™ gave me the hard truth — casinos always win. But it also gave me strategy — how to track my urges, rewire my reward system, and escape the loss loop. I treated it like a recovery plan, and it worked. I'm now 4 months clean, and for the first time in years, I’m rebuilding savings. Logic didn’t save me — this guide did. If you’re still in it, this is your way out.</p>
