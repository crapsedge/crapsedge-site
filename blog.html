    <h2>📘 What Is the Craps Edge Strategy (And Why It Works)</h2>
    <p>The CrapsEdge™ strategy is designed to help everyday players beat the emotional traps of the casino using logic, math, and personal control. Unlike flashy betting systems that promise the world and deliver losses, CrapsEdge™ focuses on reducing house edge, slowing play, and maximizing discipline.</p>

    <p>Instead of chasing hot streaks, you follow a plan: bet only on the best math-backed options (like Pass Line + Odds), limit your time at the table, and track your results. The CrapsEdge™ system includes a custom bankroll tracker and a 50-page Stop Gambling Guide built to attack addiction triggers from both a numbers and emotional angle.</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever told yourself, “just one more roll,” you’re not alone. CrapsEdge™ shows you why that mindset keeps you stuck—and how to replace it with real control. Whether you're trying to win smarter or stop completely, this strategy gives you the edge casinos don’t want you to have.</p>

  <!-- FICTIONAL EXAMPLES -->
  <section>
    <h2>🎲 James T. – “I Was 47 and Broke”</h2>
    <p>I’ve gambled since I was 18. It started with fun. Then it became survival. I was constantly chasing, lying, borrowing from my sister, using rent money for the casino. I felt worthless. I found CrapsEdge™ at a breaking point. The Stop Gambling Guide didn’t lecture — it understood. Page by page, it helped me face the damage, take control of my triggers, and for the first time in my life... stop gambling cold. Now, I’m 7 months clean. My sister actually smiles at me again. I track every dollar. I no longer need the rush — I’m addicted to peace. CrapsEdge™ saved my life, no exaggeration.</p>

    <h2>👩🏽 Jasmine M. – “I Needed a Win That Wasn’t at the Casino”</h2>
    <p>I’m a single mom. My son is 6. I used to sneak off to gamble while my mom watched him. I told myself I was trying to win for him — but I was really avoiding my emotions. CrapsEdge™ helped me see how much I was losing — not just money, but time, presence, and self-worth. The emotional parts of the guide made me cry, then act. I’ve replaced gambling with journaling, therapy, and saving. My son now sees a mom who shows up — not a mom who disappears. This product didn’t just help me quit... it helped me believe I deserve better.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Marcus P. – “From Math Whiz to Debt Prisoner”</h2>
    <p>I used to pride myself on being logical — I’m an engineer. But gambling turned me into a desperate man. I was trying to “beat the system,” convinced I had an edge. I didn’t. CrapsEdge™ gave me the hard truth — casinos always win. But it also gave me strategy — how to track my urges, rewire my reward system, and escape the loss loop. I treated it like a recovery plan, and it worked. I'm now 4 months clean, and for the first time in years, I’m rebuilding savings. Logic didn’t save me — this guide did. If you’re still in it, this is your way out.</p>
