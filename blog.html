  <p style="text-align:center;">

    <h2>📘 What the CrapsEdge™ Strategy Really Is</h2>
    <p>I’m not here to sell you some “secret system.” The truth is, casinos don’t lose because you had a hot streak — they win because they control the math and your emotions. CrapsEdge™ is about flipping that. </p>

    <p>Here’s how: you stick to the bets that actually give you a shot (Pass Line + Odds). You keep sessions short. You track every dollar. That’s it. It ain’t sexy, but it’s real. The Stop Gambling Guide and bankroll tracker I built are just tools to keep you honest with yourself.</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever caught yourself saying “one more roll,” I know that voice. CrapsEdge™ is about killing that voice and taking back control — whether you want to play smarter or walk away for good.</p>

  <!-- REAL PEOPLE EXAMPLES -->
  <section>
    <h2>🎲 Mike R. – “Didn’t Think I Had a Problem”</h2>
    <p>I thought I was fine. $100 here and there, nothing crazy. But I started chasing. CrapsEdge™ didn’t preach at me, it just made me face the numbers. Once I saw how much I was really throwing away, I pulled back. I still play sometimes, but I walk out when I said I would. That’s the win.</p>

    <h2>👩🏽 Erica D. – “Quitting’s Hard, But I’m Fighting”</h2>
    <p>I tried to quit before. Always slipped. The guide hit different — it helped me see stress was my trigger. Now I don’t touch dice unless my head’s right. I’m not perfect, but I’ve had more clean weeks than in years. I’m learning not to beat myself up when I slip. That shift came from CrapsEdge™.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Chris L. – “I Just Needed a Plan”</h2>
    <p>Winning $300 made me feel like a king, losing $500 the next day made me reckless. I never had a plan. CrapsEdge™ gave me one. Now I run a tracker, stick to two short sessions, and I don’t chase. I’ve saved more in 3 months than I did all last year.</p>
