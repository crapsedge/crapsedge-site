  <h1>Explore Winning Systems</h1>
  <p>Below are some of the most studied and talked-about craps strategies that players use to gain an edge. These systems are designed for smarter, more disciplined play. Explore each one to find what fits your goals best.</p>

  <div class="system">
    <h2>ðŸ§  Iron Cross System</h2>
    <p>This popular system involves betting on the Field and placing the 5, 6, and 8. It covers most numbers except 7 â€” but it can be vulnerable to frequent 7-outs. Works best on short hot streaks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="system">
    <h2>ðŸ“ˆ 3-Point Molly Strategy</h2>
    <p>This is a solid and conservative betting system. You place a Pass Line bet with odds, then place two Come bets with odds. It limits exposure while maximizing the house edge advantage.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="system">
    <h2>ðŸ”¥ 6/8 Pressing Method</h2>
    <p>A high-action approach where you keep pressing your winnings on 6 and 8. Works great when numbers are repeating, but it requires discipline to walk away after a few hits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="system">
    <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Power Press System</h2>
    <p>Perfect for aggressive players. You press every win, compounding your bet for bigger payouts. Dangerous if you donâ€™t stop during a cold streak, but powerful when timed right.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="system">
    <h2>ðŸ’° Don't Pass Hedge Strategy</h2>
    <p>This contrarian system bets against the shooter with Don't Pass, then hedges certain rolls with odds or Field bets. Often used by math-focused players who play the long game.</p>
